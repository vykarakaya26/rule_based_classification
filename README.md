## Predicting Customer Revenue with Rule-Based Classification


**Work Problem**


*A gaming company wants to create level-based new customer personas using some of their customer characteristics and form segments based on these new customer personas, and estimate how much they can earn from these new customers based on these segments.*
*For example, they want to determine the average amount that a 25-year-old male user in Turkey who uses IOS can earn.*


**Data Set Story**


*The "Persona.csv" data set contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic information of the users who purchased these products.
The data set is made up of records generated from each sale transaction.
This means that the table has not been de-duplicated.
In other words, a user with specific demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.*


###### Price: Spending amount of the customer
###### Source: Type of device connected by the customer
###### Sex: Gender of the customer
###### Country: Country of the customer
###### Age: Age of the customer
